In this paper, we first describe the development of the DCDP framework, showing how it was a natural extension of static discrete choice modeling. We then summarize six papers that adopt the DCDP paradigm that address substantively important social and economic questions. Finally, we consider the issue of the credibility of empirical findings based on the structural estimation of DCDP models.'</DD><DT>doi<DD>'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.red.2008.07.001'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Review of Economic Dynamics'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2009'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'12'</DD><DD>'1'</DD><DD>'1-22'</DD><DD>'1094-2025'</DD><DD>'Discrete choice dynamic programming models, Policy evaluation, Structural estimation'</DD>
