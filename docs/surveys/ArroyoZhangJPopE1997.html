Dynamic fertility models explain the evolution of fertility variates over the life-cycle as the solution to a dynamic programming model involving economic choices. Dynamic models may be classified into structural and reduced-form models. Structural models generally require solution of the underlying dynamic programming problem. Reduced-form models, while based on a structural specification, do not. Recent innovations in estimation methodologies make both types practical and realistic alternatives to static models of lifetime fertility.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Journal of Population Economics'</DD><DT>year<DD>'1997'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'09331433, 14321475'</DD><DD>'1'</DD><DD>'23--65'</DD><DD>'Springer'</DD><DD>'10'</DD>
