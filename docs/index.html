Ackerberg'</DD><DT>url<DD>'http://www.jstor.org/stable/3663546'</DD><DT>abstract<DD>'This article empirically analyzes different effects of advertising in a nondurable, experience good market. A dynamic learning model of consumer behavior is presented in which I allow both "informative" effects of advertising and "prestige" or "image" effects of advertising. This learning model is estimated using consumer level panel data tracking grocery purchases and advertising exposures over time. Empirical results suggest that in this market, advertising's primary effect was that of informing consumers. The estimates are used to quantify the value of this information to consumers and evaluate the welfare implications of an alternative advertising regulatory regime.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'International Economic Review'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2003'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00206598, 14682354'</DD><DD>'3'</DD><DD>'1007--1040'</DD><DD>'[Economics Department of the University of Pennsylvania, Wiley, Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University]'</DD><DD>'44'</DD></td></details></tr>

We consider a model where a monopolistically competitive retailer decides price and inventories, and assumes lump-sum costs when placing orders or changing nominal prices. In this model, the existence of stockout probabilities and fixed ordering costs generate a cyclical price behaviour characterized by long periods without nominal price changes and short periods with very low prices (i.e. sales promotions). We estimate this model using a unique longitudinal dataset with information about retail and wholesale prices, inventories, orders, and sales for several brands in a supermarket chain. Based on the estimated model we perform several counterfactual experiments that show the important role that inventories and fixed ordering costs play in the dynamics of retail prices and the frequency of sales promotions in this dataset.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'The Review of Economic Studies'</DD><DT>year<DD>'1999'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00346527, 1467937X'</DD><DD>'2'</DD><DD>'275--308'</DD><DD>'[Oxford University Press, Review of Economic Studies, Ltd.]'</DD><DD>'66'</DD></td></details></tr>

<DT>title<DD>'Swapping the Nested Fixed Point Algorithm: A Class of Estimators for Discrete Markov Decision Models'</DD><DT>author<DD>'Victor Aguirregabiria and Pedro Mira'</DD><DT>url<DD>'http://www.jstor.org/stable/3082006'</DD><DT>abstract<DD>'This paper proposes a new nested algorithm (NPL) for the estimation of a class of discrete Markov decision models and studies its statistical and computational properties. Our method is based on a representation of the solution of the dynamic programming problem in the space of conditional choice probabilities. When the NPL algorithm is initialized with consistent nonparametric estimates of conditional choice probabilities, successive iterations return a sequence of estimators of the structural parameters which we call K-stage policy iteration estimators. We show that the sequence includes as extreme cases a Hotz-Miller estimator (for K = 1) and Rust's nested fixed point estimator (in the limit when K → ∞). Furthermore, the asymptotic distribution of all the estimators in the sequence is the same and equal to that of the maximum likelihood estimator. We illustrate the performance of our method with several examples based on Rust's bus replacement model. Monte Carlo experiments reveal a trade-off between finite sample precision and computational cost in the sequence of policy iteration estimators.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Econometrica'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2002'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00129682, 14680262'</DD><DD>'4'</DD><DD>'1519--1543'</DD><DD>'[Wiley, Econometric Society]'</DD><DD>'70'</DD></td></details></tr>

<DT>title<DD>'Measuring the Value of Children by Sex and Age Using a Dynamic Programming Model'</DD><DT>author<DD>'Namkee Ahn'</DD><DT>url<DD>'http://www.jstor.org/stable/2298033'</DD><DT>abstract<DD>'One of the important determinants of fertility is the value of children as perceived by parents. This paper estimates gender- and age-specific values of children using a dynamic programming model. The underlying hypothesis is that observed fertility outcome for any couple is the solution to their life-cycle optimization problem. Findings from the Korean data indicate that children impose net costs when young and net benefits when old. Both the early costs and the later benefits are larger for male children than female children, and for better-educated women than lower-educated women. Simulation studies which use estimated values of children suggest that a decrease in the costs of abortion and pre-natal gender-screening tests may raise the male-birth ratio through gender-selective abortions.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'The Review of Economic Studies'</DD><DT>year<DD>'1995'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00346527, 1467937X'</DD><DD>'3'</DD><DD>'361--379'</DD><DD>'[Oxford University Press, Review of Economic Studies, Ltd.]'</DD><DD>'62'</DD></td></details></tr>

A barrier to using finite mixture models is that parameters that could previously be estimated in stages must now be estimated jointly: using mixture distributions destroys any additive separability of the log-likelihood function. We show, however, that an extension of the EM algorithm reintroduces additive separability, thus allowing one to estimate parameters sequentially during each maximization step. In establishing this result, we develop a broad class of estimators for mixture models. Returning to the likelihood problem, we show that, relative to full information maximum likelihood, our sequential estimator can generate large computational savings with little loss of efficiency.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Econometrica'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2003'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00129682, 14680262'</DD><DD>'3'</DD><DD>'933--946'</DD><DD>'[Wiley, Econometric Society]'</DD><DD>'71'</DD></td></details></tr>

About 60 percent of the differences in slopes of early life-cycle wage profiles are explained by heterogeneity while individual differences in hours worked and education explain the remaining part almost equally. We show how our model is a particularly useful tool to comprehend the distinctions between compulsory schooling and a reduction in the cost of higher education. Finally, because policy changes induce simultaneous movements in observed choices and average per-year effects, linear instrumental variable (IV) estimates generated by those policy changes are uninformative about the returns to education for those affected. This is especially true for compulsory schooling estimates as they exceed IV estimates generated by the reduction in the cost of higher education even if the latter policy affects individuals with much higher returns than than those affected by compulsory schooling.'</DD><DT>doi<DD>'https://doi.org/10.3982/QE321'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Quantitative Economics'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2017'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'8'</DD><DD>'3'</DD><DD>'895-927'</DD><DD>'Dynamic skill accumulation, education policies, returns to schooling, learning-by-doing, life-cycle labor supply, IV estimation, I2, J1, J3'</DD><DD>'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.3982/QE321'</DD></td></details></tr>

Then a dynamic model, with β = .95, is estimated. In both models, it is found that bad health, age, and lack of education increase the probability of retirement. The dynamic model performs better than the static model and has different implications for retirement behavior.

<DT>title<DD>'Cohabitation, Marriage, and Divorce in a Model of Match Quality'</DD><DT>author<DD>'Michael J. Brien and Lee A. Lillard and Steven Stern'</DD><DT>url<DD>'http://www.jstor.org/stable/3663512'</DD><DT>abstract<DD>'The objective of this research is to further our understanding of how and why individuals enter and leave coresidential relationships. We develop and estimate an economic model of nonmarital cohabitation, marriage, and divorce that is consistent with current data on the formation and dissolution of relationships. Jovanovic's (Journal of Political Economy 87 (1979), 972-90) theoretical matching model is extended to help explain household formation and dissolution behavior. Implications of the model reveal what factors influence the decision to start a relationship, what form this relationship will take, and the relative stability of the various types of unions. The structural parameters of the model are estimated using longitudinal data from a sample of female high school seniors from the United States. New numerical methods are developed to reduce computational costs associated with estimation. The empirical results have interesting interpretations given the structural model.

Details of various policies including welfare time limits, work requirements, and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) are incorporated formally in the budget constraint. Policy simulations reveal that the economy accounts for half of the increase in the labor supply of female heads of family between 1992 and 1999. A time limit results in a larger efficiency gain than a work requirement or a direct reduction in welfare benefits. A reform package can lead to both a reduction in the government expenditure and an improvement in utility. The EITC expansion results in a substantial efficiency gain among individuals with the lowest expected wage. These individuals are almost unaffected by the economic expansion, but their income and utility increase significantly under the reform package.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Econometrica'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2013'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00129682, 14680262'</DD><DD>'3'</DD><DD>'941--1001'</DD><DD>'[Wiley, Econometric Society]'</DD><DD>'81'</DD></td></details></tr>

<DT>title<DD>'The Flat Rental Puzzle'</DD><DT>author<DD>'SUNGJIN CHO and JOHN RUST'</DD><DT>url<DD>'http://www.jstor.org/stable/40587639'</DD><DT>abstract<DD>'Why is the price of renting an automobile "flat" as a function of its age or odometer value? Specifically, why is it that car rental companies do not offer customers the option of renting older cars at a discount, instead of offering only relatively new cars at full price? We also tackle a related puzzle: why do car rental companies trade-in their vehicles so early? Most US companies purchase brand new rental cars and replace them after 2 years or when their odometer exceeds 34,000 km. That is a very costly strategy due to the well-known by rapid depreciation in used car prices. We show that in a competitive rental market, prices are a declining function of odometer and cars are rented over their full economic lifespan. Our solution to these puzzles is that actual rental markets are not fully competitive and firms may be behaving suboptimally. We provide a case study of a large car rental company that provided us access to its operating data. We develop a model of the company's operations that predicts that the company can significantly increase its profits by keeping its rental cars twice as long as it currently does, discounting the rental prices of older vehicles to induce its customers to rent them. The company undertook an experiment to test our model's predictions. We report initial findings from this experiment which involved over 4500 rentals of over 500 cars in 4 locations over a 5-month period. The results are consistent with the predictions of our model, and suggest that a properly chosen declining rental price function can increase overall revenues. Profits also increase significantly, since doubling the holding period of rental cars cuts discounted replacement costs by nearly 40%.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'The Review of Economic Studies'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2010'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00346527, 1467937X'</DD><DD>'2'</DD><DD>'560--594'</DD><DD>'[Oxford University Press, Review of Economic Studies, Ltd.]'</DD><DD>'77'</DD></td></details></tr>

We estimate a dynamic matching model of demand under uncertainty in which patients learn from prescription experience about the effectiveness of alternative drugs. Unlike previous models, we allow drugs to have distinct symptomatic and curative effects, and endogenize treatment length by allowing drug choices to affect patients' underlying probability of recovery. We find that drugs' rankings along these dimensions differ, with high symptomatic effects for drugs with the highest market shares and high curative effects for drugs with the greatest medical efficacy. Our results also indicate that while there is substantial heterogeneity in drug efficacy across patients, learning enables patients and their doctors to dramatically reduce the costs of uncertainty in pharmaceutical markets.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Econometrica'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2005'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00129682, 14680262'</DD><DD>'4'</DD><DD>'1137--1173'</DD><DD>'[Wiley, Econometric Society]'</DD><DD>'73'</DD></td></details></tr>

We estimate a model of the cognitive development process of children nested within an otherwise standard model of household behaviour. The household makes labour supply decisions and provides time and money inputs into the child quality production process during the development period. Our empirical results indicate that both parents' time inputs are important for the cognitive development of their children, particularly when the child is young. Money expenditures are less productive in terms of producing child quality. Comparative statics exercises demonstrate that cash transfers to households with children have small impacts on child quality due to the relatively low impact of money investments on child outcomes and the fact that a significant fraction of the transfer is spent on other household consumption and the leisure of the parents.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'The Review of Economic Studies'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2014'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00346527, 1467937X'</DD><DD>'1 (286)'</DD><DD>'137--185'</DD><DD>'[Oxford University Press, The Review of Economic Studies, Ltd.]'</DD><DD>'81'</DD></td></details></tr>

However, while the employment rate of married women more than doubled during the last 50 years, that of unmarried women remained almost constant. To empirically analyze these trends, we estimate a female dynamic labor supply model using an extended version of Eckstein and Wolpin (1989) to compare the various explanations in the literature for the observed trends. This dynamic model provides a much better fit to the life-cycle employment pattern than a static version of the model and a standard static reduced form model (Heckman (1979)). The main finding using the dynamic model is that the rise in education levels accounts for about 33 percent of the increase in female employment, and the rise in wages and narrowing of the gender wage gap account for another 20 percent, while about 40 percent remains unexplained by observed household characteristics. We show that this unexplained portion can be empirically attributed to cohort-specific changes in preferences or the costs of child-rearing and household maintenance. Finally, the decline in fertility and the increase in divorce rates account for only a small share of the increase in female employment rates.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Econometrica'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2011'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00129682, 14680262'</DD><DD>'6'</DD><DD>'1675--1726'</DD><DD>'[Wiley, Econometric Society]'</DD><DD>'79'</DD></td></details></tr>

The equilibrium model is adapted from Albrecht and Axell (1984) and is based on workers who are homogeneous in terms of market productivity and heterogeneous in terms of nonmarket productivity, and on firms which are heterogeneous in terms of productive efficiency. The equilibrium model is contrasted in terms of its fit to the data with an unrestricted version of the model which is based on a mixture of negative binomial distributions. The equilibrium model fails to conform to the data in exactly the dimension of its major focus, namely it implies that measurement error accounts for almost all of the dispersion in observed wages. The equilibrium model also does not do well in fitting the unemployment duration distribution compared to the unrestricted model. The problem is that the duration distribution itself does not support the existence of significant heterogeneity, as evidenced by the estimates of the unrestricted model. The paper also illustrates the use of such models for policy analysis by simulating the welfare effects of a minimum wage.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Econometrica'</DD><DT>year<DD>'1990'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00129682, 14680262'</DD><DD>'4'</DD><DD>'783--808'</DD><DD>'[Wiley, Econometric Society]'</DD><DD>'58'</DD></td></details></tr>

Because current participation alters future potential earnings, the investment return to work will be an important factor in the current work decision in any forward-looking behavioural model. The model is estimated using the National Longitudinal Surveys mature women's cohort. We use the estimates of our model to predict changes in the lifecycle patterns of employment due to changes in schooling, fertility, husband's income, and the magnitude of the experience effect on wages. We find that although work experience increases the disutility of further work, the effect is overwhelmed by the positive effect of experience on wages, leading to persistence in the employment patterns of these women. In addition we find that an increase in young children and in husband's income substantially reduces participation while increased schooling has a powerful positive impact on participation. _pg 375-390'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'The Review of Economic Studies'</DD><DT>year<DD>'1989'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00346527, 1467937X'</DD><DD>'3'</DD><DD>'375--390'</DD><DD>'[Oxford University Press, Review of Economic Studies, Ltd.]'</DD><DD>'56'</DD></td></details></tr>

The model provides an interpretation of the observations on duration to first job and accepted wages that differentiates between behavioural influences and market fundamentals in determining the accepted wage-schooling relationship. The return to schooling is appropriately measured by differences in the wage offer distribution, which depends only on market fundamentals. We use data from the 1979 youth cohort of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience to follow several school-leaving cohorts of young males. A model which allows for five types of heterogeneous workers within schooling/race groups fits the duration and wage data well for all such groups. Offer probabilities for all groups are estimated to be close to one. Mean offered wages are about $1000 less than mean accepted wages and the internal annual rate of return for attending college relative to graduating from high school is $32\tt\%$ for blacks and 17% for whites.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'The Review of Economic Studies'</DD><DT>year<DD>'1995'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00346527, 1467937X'</DD><DD>'2'</DD><DD>'263--286'</DD><DD>'[Oxford University Press, Review of Economic Studies, Ltd.]'</DD><DD>'62'</DD></td></details></tr>

<DT>title<DD>'Decision-Making under Uncertainty: Capturing Dynamic Brand Choice Processes in Turbulent Consumer Goods Markets'</DD><DT>author<DD>'Tülin Erdem and Michael P. Keane'</DD><DT>url<DD>'http://www.jstor.org/stable/184181'</DD><DT>abstract<DD>'We construct two models of the behavior of consumers in an environment where there is uncertainty about brand attributes. In our models, both usage experience and advertising exposure give consumers noisy signals about brand attributes. Consumers use these signals to update their expectations of brand attributes in a Bayesian manner. The two models are (1) a dynamic model with immediate utility maximization, and (2) a dynamic "forward-looking" model in which consumers maximize the expected present value of utility over a planning horizon. Given this theoretical framework, we derive from the Bayesian learning framework how brand choice probabilities depend on past usage experience and advertising exposures. We then form likelihood functions for the models and estimate them on Nielsen scanner data for detergent. We find that the functional forms for experience and advertising effects that we derive from the Bayesian learning framework fit the data very well relative to flexible ad hoc functional forms such as exponential smoothing, and also perform better at out-of-sample prediction. Another finding is that in the context of consumer learning of product attributes, although the forward-looking model fits the data statistically better at conventional significance levels, both models produce similar parameter estimates and policy implications. Our estimates indicate that consumers are risk-averse with respect to variation in brand attributes, which discourages them from buying unfamiliar brands. Using the estimated behavioral models, we perform various scenario evaluations to find how changes in marketing strategy affect brand choice both in the short and long run. A key finding obtained from the policy experiments is that advertising intensity has only weak short run effects, but a strong cumulative effect in the long run. The substantive content of the paper is potentially of interest to academics in marketing, economics and decision sciences, as well as product managers, marketing research managers and analysts interested in studying the effectiveness of marketing mix strategies. Our paper will be of particular interest to those interested in the long run effects of advertising. Note that our estimation strategy requires us to specify explicit behavioral models of consumer choice behavior, derive the implied relationships among choice probabilities, past purchases and marketing mix variables, and then estimate the behavioral parameters of each model. Such an estimation strategy is referred to as "structural" estimation, and econometric models that are based explicitly on the consumer's maximization problem and whose parameters are parameters of the consumers' utility functions or of their constraints are referred to as "structural" models. A key benefit of the structural approach is its potential usefulness for policy evaluation. The parameters of structural models are invariant to policy, that is, they do not change due to a change in the policy. In contrast, the parameters of reduced form brand choice models are, in general, functions of marketing strategy variables (e.g., consumer response to price may depend on pricing policy). As a result, the predictions of reduced form models for the outcomes of policy experiments may be unreliable, because in making the prediction one must assume that the model parameters are unaffected by the policy change. Since the agents in our models choose among many alternative brands, their choice probabilities take the form of higher-order integrals. We employ Monte-Carlo methods to approximate these integrals and estimate our models using simulated maximum likelihood. Estimation of the dynamic forward-looking model also requires that a dynamic programming problem be solved in order to form the likelihood function. For this we use a new approximation method based on simulation and interpolation techniques. These estimation techniques may be of interest to researchers and policy makers in many fields where dynamic choice among discrete alternatives is important, such as marketing, decision sciences, labor and health economics, and industrial organization.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Marketing Science'</DD><DT>year<DD>'1996'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'07322399, 1526548X'</DD><DD>'1'</DD><DD>'1--20'</DD><DD>'INFORMS'</DD><DD>'15'</DD></td></details></tr>

The focus of the estimation is on measuring flexibility in production and intertemporal substitutability in consumption. Full information maximum likelihood estimates of the primitive parameters of the model are computed even though optimal labor decision rules cannot be derived analytically. Vuong's non-nested model specification test shows that this method yields parameter estimates that are superior to those derived by assuming that farmers solve a deterministic control problem. The low levels of agricultural labor effort commonly observed in the survey area are shown to be a consequence both of the low productivity of labor in archaic rainfed agriculture and of farmers' awareness that, in the absence of a labor market, overly ambitious production plans lead to seasonal manpower constraints. To meet rainfed farmers' concerns, agricultural research institutes and extension services should factor flexibility into their research agendas.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Econometrica'</DD><DT>year<DD>'1993'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00129682, 14680262'</DD><DD>'5'</DD><DD>'1173--1197'</DD><DD>'[Wiley, Econometric Society]'</DD><DD>'61'</DD></td></details></tr>

The level of UI benefits depends on previous earnings, which creates opposing incentives for unemployed people not receiving benefits. Which of these opposing incentives dominates the other is found to differ across demographic groups within each country. Changes in UI policy therefore can have very different effects on different individuals. The major differences found in the transition from school to work in Canada and the United States are a lower rate of job-offer arrivals and a lower rate of offer rejections in Canada. Within each country, offer-arrival rates differ across individuals much more than offer-rejection rates.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Journal of Business & Economic Statistics'</DD><DT>year<DD>'1997'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'07350015'</DD><DD>'2'</DD><DD>'115--129'</DD><DD>'[American Statistical Association, Taylor & Francis, Ltd.]'</DD><DD>'15'</DD></td></details></tr>

Methods for estimating dynamic programming models with unobserved heterogeneity are extended to account for unexpected policy interventions and endogenous sample selection and initial conditions. Parameters are identified and consistently estimated by imposing optimal responses to the exact form of the SSP earnings supplement and the experimental program, which induces exogenous variation between treatment groups and within groups as treatment progresses. The estimated model tracks primary outcomes well in and out of sample, except for underestimating trends in the sample of new welfare applicants. Predictions from counterfactual experiments run counter to non-structural results reported elsewhere, and they suggest that details of the SSP's design are critical for interpretation of results. The separate SSP Plus treatment may have longer lasting and more generalized impacts than the in-sample impacts suggest.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'The Review of Economic Studies'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2012'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00346527, 1467937X'</DD><DD>'4'</DD><DD>'1495--1526'</DD><DD>'[Oxford University Press, Review of Economic Studies, Ltd.]'</DD><DD>'79'</DD></td></details></tr>

Although minimum wage increases may or may not lead to increases in unemployment in our model, they can be welfare-improving to labor market participants on both the supply and demand sides of the labor market. We discuss identification of the model using Current Population Survey data on accepted wages and unemployment durations, and show that by incorporating a limited amount of information from the demand side of the market it is possible to obtain credible and precise estimates of all primitive parameters. We show that the optimal minimum wage in 1996 depends critically on whether or not contact rates can be considered to be exogenous and we note that the limited variation in minimum wages makes testing this assumption problematic.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Econometrica'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2006'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00129682, 14680262'</DD><DD>'4'</DD><DD>'1013--1062'</DD><DD>'[Wiley, Econometric Society]'</DD><DD>'74'</DD></td></details></tr>

The method of simulated moments is used to match the life cycle profiles of labour force participation, hours worked, and assets that are estimated from the data to those that are generated by the model. The model establishes that the tax structure of the Social Security system and pensions are key determinants of the high observed job exit rates at ages 62 and 65. Removing the tax wedge embedded in the Social Security earnings test for individuals aged 65 and older would delay job exit by almost one year. By contrast, Social Security benefit levels, health, and borrowing constraints are less important determinants of job exit at older ages. For example, reducing Social Security benefits by 20% would cause workers to delay exit from the labour force by only three months.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'The Review of Economic Studies'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2005'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00346527, 1467937X'</DD><DD>'2'</DD><DD>'395--427'</DD><DD>'[Oxford University Press, The Review of Economic Studies, Ltd.]'</DD><DD>'72'</DD></td></details></tr>

This dataset reveals a very asymmetric labor market for household members who share that their job finding is stimulated by their partners' job separation. We uncover a job search-theoretic basis for this added worker effect, which occurs mainly during economic downturns, but also by increased nonemployment transfers. Thus, our analysis shows that the policy goal of increasing nonemployment transfers to support a worker's job search is partially offset by the spouse's cross effect of decreased nonemployment and wages. The added worker effect is robust to having more children and more education in the household and does not just result as a composition of heterogeneous individuals. We also show that the interdependency between household members is understated if wealth and savings are not considered. Finally, we show that gender equality in the labor market not only improves women's labor market performance, but it also increases men's accepted wages and nonemployment rates.'</DD><DT>doi<DD>'https://doi.org/10.3982/QE1092'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Quantitative Economics'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2020'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'11'</DD><DD>'4'</DD><DD>'1431-1459'</DD><DD>'Job search, asset accumulation, household economics, consumption, nonemployment, estimation of dynamic structural models, C33, E21, E24, J64'</DD><DD>'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.3982/QE1092'</DD></td></details></tr>

After controlling for all the sources of selection and endogeneity, the estimates indicate that a given worker does earn more in the city for white-collar work, but not for blue-collar work. In addition, city work experience is found to be worth more than rural work experience in the rural area for white-collar work, but not for blue-collar work. These results support the interpretation that cities make white-collar workers more productive and suggest that workers may consider moving to the city not only in terms of locational choice, but also as a form of human capital investment.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'The Review of Economic Studies'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2007'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00346527, 1467937X'</DD><DD>'2'</DD><DD>'477--506'</DD><DD>'[Oxford University Press, Review of Economic Studies, Ltd.]'</DD><DD>'74'</DD></td></details></tr>

We measure the sensitivity of the customers to receiving a catalog in the mail, while controlling for customer characteristics such as elapsed time in responses and number of purchases. We apply our model to a database from a national cataloger that markets nonseasonal products. We summarize the results of our model that are valid for these types of products. We find that the dynamic model significantly outperforms its single-period counterpart. We find that it is not optimal to mail to individuals at low recency levels because they are likely to buy anyway. It is better to save the mailing dollars for customers at higher recency levels. We find that it is optimal to mail to customers who have purchased only a small or a medium number of times to induce them to continue to buy from this catalog and not switch to others. It is not necessary to mail often to customers who have purchased many times before from the company unless they have high recency values. We find that under the optimal mailing policy the cataloguer enjoys higher profits than under the current mailing policy.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Management Science'</DD><DT>year<DD>'1998'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00251909, 15265501'</DD><DD>'9'</DD><DD>'1249--1262'</DD><DD>'INFORMS'</DD><DD>'44'</DD></td></details></tr>

<DT>title<DD>'Estimating the Impact of Consumer Expectations of Coupons on Purchase Behavior: A Dynamic Structural Model'</DD><DT>author<DD>'Füsun Gönül and Kannan Srinivasan'</DD><DT>url<DD>'http://www.jstor.org/stable/184122'</DD><DT>abstract<DD>'We examine the basic premise that consumers may anticipate future promotions and adjust their purchase behavior accordingly. We develop a structural model of households who make purchase decisions to minimize their expenditure over a finite period. The model allows for future expectations of promotions to enter the purchase decision. Households with adequate inventory of the product may face a trade-off of buying in the current period with a coupon or defer the purchase until next period, given their expectations of future promotions. Thus, we provide a framework for examining the impact of consumer expectations on choice behavior. The target audiences for our paper are (a) empirical researchers who intend to make structural models part of their applied research agenda; and (b) managers who value and seek to understand the impact of consumers' coupon expectations on current purchase behavior. Our research objective is to provide an empirical framework to examine whether and to what extent consumers anticipate future coupon promotions and adjust purchase behavior. The central premise of our approach is that a rational consumer minimizes the present discounted value of the cost of a purchase where cost in a single period consists of purchase price, inventory holding cost, gains from coupons, and potential stockout cost. We aim to test whether our hypotheses regarding the various elements of the cost structure are supported and that whether consumers take into account future discounted cost when making current purchase decisions. The research methodology we adopt is relatively new in econometrics and known as the estimable stochastic structural dynamic programming method. The methodology amounts to incorporating a maximum likelihood routine embedded in a dynamic programming problem. The dynamic programming problem is solved several times within a maximum likelihood iteration for each value of the state space elements and for each value of the parameters in the parameter set. The state space in our model consists of purchase and nonpurchase alternatives in each time period, coupon availability and no coupon availability in each time period, level of inventory in each time period for each household, and consumption rate of each household. We use scanner panel data on purchases in the disposable diaper product category and promotions. We estimate the inventory holding and stockout costs, brand-specific value of coupons, and consumers' expectations of future coupons. The key insights and lessons learned can be summarized as follows: (1) Our results are consistent with the notion that consumers hold beliefs about future coupons, and that such beliefs affect the purchase decision. We find that the dynamic optimization model performs significantly better than a single-period optimization model and a naive benchmark model. (2) We find a high and significant stockout cost, consistent with the essential nature of the product category. Our estimate of the holding cost yields a reasonable annualized percentage value when converted to the cost of capital. We find that consumer valuation of coupons differ markedly across brands. (3) Our empirical evidence supports the notion that consumers hold beliefs about future coupon availability. We also find that the expectations about future coupons, estimated endogenously, differ depending upon whether or not a coupon was available in the current period. Thus, the proposed model structure yields rich managerial insights and facilitates several "what if" scenarios. A possible limitation of our model, and estimable structural models in general, is the computational cost. While it is possible to conceptually extend the state space to accommodate variations across households and add a richer parameter structure, each addition multiplies the size of the state space and the computation time. For this reason, we have kept the state space as tight as possible and refrained from additions that would otherwise enable us to incorporate heterogeneity in consumer decisions. For example, we assumed that consumers are similar other than reflected by their purchase behavior. We built a category purchase incidence model rather than a brand choice model. We refrained from including unobserved heterogeneity in the parameters. We chose to opt out of modeling autocorrelation and other time-dependent error term patterns in the likelihood function. Thus, we have made an effort to build a structural model that reasonably reflects consumer purchase behavior without requiring expensive computation. Currently, there are developments in econometrics to approximate the computation of the valuation functions without sacrificing much accuracy. When these methods are well developed we expect that structural models will become more commonplace in marketing.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Marketing Science'</DD><DT>year<DD>'1996'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'07322399, 1526548X'</DD><DD>'3'</DD><DD>'262--279'</DD><DD>'INFORMS'</DD><DD>'15'</DD></td></details></tr>

We show the valuation functions characterizing the expected future utility associated with the choices often can be represented as an easily computed function of the state variables, structural parameters, and the probabilities of choosing alternative actions for states which are feasible in the future. Under certain conditions, nonparametric estimators of these probabilities can be formed from sample information on the relative frequencies of observed choices using observations with the same (or similar) state variables. Substituting the estimators for the true conditional choice probabilities in formulating optimal decision rules, we establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the resulting structural parameter estimators.

As a result, the computational burden of estimating a dynamic model becomes comparable to that of a static model. Another feature of our algorithm is that even though the number of grid points on the state variable is small per solution-estimation iteration, the number of effective grid points increases with the number of estimation iterations. This is how we help ease the "curse of dimensionality." We simulate and estimate several versions of a simple model of entry and exit to illustrate our methodology.

The model is estimated using panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth on white males with a high-school education. Our main conclusion is that interstate migration decisions are influenced to a substantial extent by income prospects.

The estimation strategy is computationally simple as it does not require solving for the equilibrium of the game. It uses a two stage approach. In the first stage the distribution of bids conditional on state variables is estimated using data on bids, bidder characteristics, and contract characteristics. In the second stage, an expression of the expected sum of future profits based on the distribution of bids is obtained, and costs are inferred based on the first order condition of optimal bids. We apply the estimation method to repeated highway construction procurement auctions in the state of California between May 1996 and May 1999. In this market, previously won uncompleted contracts reduce the probability of winning further contracts. We quantify the effect of intertemporal constraints on bidders' costs and on bids. Due to the intertemporal effect and also to bidder asymmetry, the auction can be inefficient. Based on the estimates of costs, we quantify efficiency losses.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Econometrica'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2003'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00129682, 14680262'</DD><DD>'5'</DD><DD>'1443--1489'</DD><DD>'[Wiley, Econometric Society]'</DD><DD>'71'</DD></td></details></tr>

Between 1950 and 2000, service-sector employment grew from 57 to 75 percent of total employment. However, over this time, the real hourly wage in the service sector grew only slightly faster than in the goods sector. In this paper, we assess whether or not the essential constancy of the relative wage implies that individuals face small costs of switching sectors, and we quantify the relative importance of labor supply and demand factors in the growth of the service sector. We specify and estimate a two-sector labor market equilibrium model that allows us to address these empirical issues in a unified framework. Our estimates imply that there are large mobility costs: output in both sectors would have been double their current levels if these mobility costs had been zero. In addition, we find that demand-side factors, that is, technological change and movements in product and capital prices, were responsible for the growth of the service sector.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Econometrica'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2006'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00129682, 14680262'</DD><DD>'1'</DD><DD>'1--46'</DD><DD>'[Wiley, Econometric Society]'</DD><DD>'74'</DD></td></details></tr>

Since patents are often applied for at an early exploratory stage of the innovation process, the model allows patentees to be uncertain about the sequence of returns that will be earned if the patent is kept in force. The paper solves the implied optimal stopping problem for the micro units, derives the implications of these solutions on the aggregate proportion renewed, and then estimates the parameters of the model from the aggregate data.

The null hypothesis is that Zurcher's decisions on bus engine replacement coincide with an optimal stopping rule: a strategy which specifies whether or not to replace the current bus engine each period as a function of observed and unobserved state variables. The optimal stopping rule is the solution to a stochastic dynamic programming problem that formalizes the trade-off between the conflicting objectives of minimizing maintenance costs versus minimizing unexpected engine failures. The model depends on unknown "primitive parameters" which specify Zurcher's expectations of the future values of the state variables, the expected costs of regular bus maintenance, and his perceptions of the customer goodwill costs of unexpected failures. Using ten years of monthly data on bus mileage and engine replacements for a subsample of 104 buses in the company fleet, I estimate these primitive parameters and test whether Zurcher's behavior is consistent with the model. Admittedly, few people are likely to take particular interest in Harold Zurcher and bus engine replacement per se. I focus on a specific individual and capital good because it provides a simple, concrete framework to illustrate two ideas: (i) a "bottom-up" approach for modelling replacement investment, and (ii) a "nested fixed point" algorithm for estimating dynamic programming models of discrete choice.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Econometrica'</DD><DT>year<DD>'1987'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00129682, 14680262'</DD><DD>'5'</DD><DD>'999--1033'</DD><DD>'[Wiley, Econometric Society]'</DD><DD>'55'</DD></td></details></tr>

We estimate a dynamic programming (DP) model of the joint labor supply and Social Security acceptance decision, focusing on a sample of males in the low to middle income brackets whose only pension is Social Security. The DP model delivers a rich set of predictions about the dynamics of retirement behavior, and comparisons of actual vs. predicted behavior show that the DP model is able to account for a wide variety of phenomena observed in the data, including the pronounced peaks in the distribution of retirement ages at 62 and 65 (the ages of early and normal eligibility for Social Security benefits, respectively). We identify a significant fraction of "health insurance constrained" individuals who have no form of retiree health insurance other than Medicare, and who can only obtain fairly priced private health insurance via their employer's group health plan. The combination of significant individual risk aversion and a long tailed (Pareto) distribution of health care expenditures implies that there is a significant "security value" for these individuals to remain employed until they are eligible for Medicare coverage at age 65. Overall, our model suggests that a number of heretofore puzzling aspects of retirement behavior can be viewed as artifacts of particular details of the Social Security rules, whose incentive effects are especially strong for lower income individuals and those who do not have access to fairly priced loans, annuities, and health insurance.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Econometrica'</DD><DT>year<DD>'1997'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00129682, 14680262'</DD><DD>'4'</DD><DD>'781--831'</DD><DD>'[Wiley, Econometric Society]'</DD><DD>'65'</DD></td></details></tr>

<DT>title<DD>'Optimal Response to a Shift in Regulatory Regime: The Case of the US Nuclear Power Industry'</DD><DT>author<DD>'John Rust and Geoffrey Rothwell'</DD><DT>url<DD>'http://www.jstor.org/stable/2285015'</DD><DT>abstract<DD>'This paper studies the impact of the March 1979 Three Mile Island (TMI) accident on the regulation of nuclear power plants (NPPs) and its consequences for the operating behaviour and profitability of the US nuclear power industry. We treat the TMI accident as a `natural experiment' that caused a sudden, unexpected, and permanent increase in the intensity of safety regulation by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and a shift towards increased disallowances of operating costs by state and local public utility commissions (PUCs). We analyse the nuclear power industry's reaction to this shift in regulatory regime using detailed monthly data on NPP operations collected by the NRC. One of the industry's responses was to increase the planned durations between refuellings from 12 months in the pre-TMI period to 18 months in the post-TMI period. We estimate a simple dynamic programming (DP) model of NPP operations that shows how an operator optimally balances the potential increases in capacity utilization rates associated with longer operating cycles against the increased costs of unplanned and forced outages associated with longer cycles. Under the maintained hypothesis that NPP operators seek to maximize expected discounted profits, we use the NPP operating data to infer profit functions for NPPs in the pre- and post-TMI periods. The estimated profit functions reveal that utilities have been responsive to NRC regulation insofar as they impute a significantly higher cost to `imprudent' operation of a reactor in the post-TMI period than in the pre-TMI period. The results show that utilities responded optimally to the change in regulatory regime since the DP model predicts that optimal planned operating cycles were approximately 12 months in the pre-TMI period and 18 months in the post-TMI period. We find that while NPPs appear safer in the post-TMI period (in terms of having a lower rate of forced outages), they are also substantially less profitable: over 90% of the expected discounted profits from continued operation of existing NPPs have been eliminated in the post-TMI period. However, since most of the investments in existing NPPs are already sunk and given the high costs of plant decommissioning, the DP model predicts that utilities will continue to operate NPPs rather than shut them down. Interestingly, we find that the hypothesis of expected discounted profit maximization provides a much better approximation to NPP operating behaviour in the post-TMI period than in the pre-TMI period.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Journal of Applied Econometrics'</DD><DT>year<DD>'1995'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'08837252, 10991255'</DD><DD>'}'</DD><DD>'S75--S118'</DD><DD>'Wiley'</DD><DD>'10'</DD></td></details></tr>

The main purpose of the paper is to measure the effect of short-term parental cash transfers, received during school, on educational borrowing and in-school work decisions, and on post-graduation lifetime earnings. The estimated parameters of the model imply that parental cash transfers do not significantly influence post-graduation lifetime earnings. Long-term factors such as family background and prior human capital investments are more important. Parental cash transfers do, however, significantly determine the decision to borrow or work during school and the level of lifetime consumption.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'The Review of Economic Studies'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2004'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00346527, 1467937X'</DD><DD>'4'</DD><DD>'1189--1216'</DD><DD>'[Oxford University Press, Review of Economic Studies, Ltd.]'</DD><DD>'71'</DD></td></details></tr>

To answer this question, I develop a dynamic, equilibrium model of marriage. Two explanations for the racial differences in behavior are considered: differences in population supplies and wages. Black‐white differences in population supplies explain one‐fifth of the difference in marriage rates and between one‐fifth and one‐third of the differences in employment rates across race. Removing the racial gap in wages eliminates the differences in employment but increases the differences in marriage rates.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Journal of Labor Economics'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2009'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'0734306X, 15375307'</DD><DD>'3'</DD><DD>'385--437'</DD><DD>'[The University of Chicago Press, Society of Labor Economists, NORC at the University of Chicago]'</DD><DD>'27'</DD></td></details></tr>

The results show that the model's predicted program impacts track the experimental results.
