We show that the structural parameters are identified using labor market survey data. Estimation results for a black and white high school graduate sample imply: black productivity is 3.3% lower than white productivity; the employer's disutility factor is 31% of the white's productivity level; and 56% of firms have a disutility factor toward blacks.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'International Economic Review'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2002'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00206598, 14682354'</DD><DD>'4'</DD><DD>'1309--1345'</DD><DD>'[Economics Department of the University of Pennsylvania, Wiley, Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University]'</DD><DD>'43'</DD>
