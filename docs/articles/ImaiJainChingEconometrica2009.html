The model improves on previous work in two respects: it covers optimal sequences of location decisions (rather than a single once-for-all choice) and it allows for many alternative location choices. The model is estimated using panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth on white males with a high-school education. Our main conclusion is that interstate migration decisions are influenced to a substantial extent by income prospects. The results suggest that the link between income and migration decisions is driven both by geographic differences in mean wages and by a tendency to move in search of a better locational match when the income realization in the current location is unfavorable.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Econometrica'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2011'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00129682, 14680262'</DD><DD>'1'</DD><DD>'211--251'</DD><DD>'[Wiley, Econometric Society]'</DD><DD>'79'</DD>
