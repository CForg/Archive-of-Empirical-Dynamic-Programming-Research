Using comprehensive administrative data, we show that the French hiring credit, implemented during the Great Recession, had significant positive employment effects and no effects on wages. Relying on the quasi-experimental variation in labour cost triggered by the hiring credit, we estimate a structural search and matching model. Simulations of counterfactual policies show that the effectiveness of the hiring credit relied to a large extent on three features: it was non-anticipated, temporary and targeted at jobs with rigid wages. We estimate that the cost per job created by permanent hiring credits, either countercyclical or time-invariant, in an environment with flexible wages would have been much higher.'</DD><DT>doi<DD>'10.1093/restud/rdy011'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'The Review of Economic Studies'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2018'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'86'</DD><DD>'2'</DD><DD>'593-626'</DD><DD>'01'</DD><DD>'0034-6527'</DD><DD>'https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-pdf/86/2/593/27980341/rdy011.pdf'</DD>
