<DT>title<DD>'Structural versus Reduced-Form Estimation of Optimal Stopping Problems'</DD><DT>author<DD>'Bill Provencher'</DD><DT>url<DD>'http://www.jstor.org/stable/1244135'</DD><DT>abstract<DD>'In this paper I examine several statistical, interpretive, and policy implications of reduced-form (probit or logit) estimation of optimal stopping problems. The discussion proceeds in the context of an examination of the timber harvest decision of nonindustrial private forest (NIPF) owners. For a large class of optimal stopping problems a reduced-form model which closely approximates the statistical performance of its structural counterpart is readily found. Still, failure to properly interpret the relationship between the reduced-form model and the underlying optimal stopping problem invites flawed econometric analysis and inappropriate interpretation of reduced-form coefficients.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'American Journal of Agricultural Economics'</DD><DT>year<DD>'1997'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00029092, 14678276'</DD><DD>'2'</DD><DD>'357--368'</DD><DD>'[Agricultural & Applied Economics Association, Oxford University Press]'</DD><DD>'79'</DD>
