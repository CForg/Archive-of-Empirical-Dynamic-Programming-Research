<DT>title<DD>'Estimating a Simultaneous Search Model'</DD><DT>author<DD>'Steven Stern'</DD><DT>url<DD>'http://www.jstor.org/stable/2535293'</DD><DT>abstract<DD>'The primary goal of this article is to specify and estimate a structural simultaneous search model and then determine the empirical importance of simultaneous search. The results indicate that new labor force entrants search simultaneously. A secondary goal is to identify and estimate job offer arrival rates and wage offer rejection probabilities separately. The results indicate that a significant portion of unemployment spells are caused by slow arrival rates, but policies intended to speed arrival rates would increase the average length of unemployment spells.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Journal of Labor Economics'</DD><DT>year<DD>'1989'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'0734306X, 15375307'</DD><DD>'3'</DD><DD>'348--369'</DD><DD>'[University of Chicago Press, Society of Labor Economists, NORC at the University of Chicago]'</DD><DD>'7'</DD>
