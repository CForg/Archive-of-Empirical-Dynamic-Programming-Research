We find negligible strategic effects in all three sports: teams play as well as possible in each game regardless of the game's importance in the series. We also estimate negligible unobserved heterogeneity after controlling for regular season records and past appearance in the championship series: Teams are estimated to be exactly as strong as they appear on paper.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'The Review of Economics and Statistics'</DD><DT>year<DD>'1999'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00346535, 15309142'</DD><DD>'4'</DD><DD>'704--719'</DD><DD>'The MIT Press'</DD><DD>'81'</DD>
