We estimate the time to application from the point at which a health condition first begins to affect the kind or amount of work that a currently employed person can do. We use Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and restricted access Social Security earnings data for estimation. Our results show that the type of work-limiting health condition, presence of employer accommodation, and the relative value of income in the application state to income in the work state significantly affect the timing of SSDI application.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Journal of Applied Econometrics'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2004'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'08837252, 10991255'</DD><DD>'6'</DD><DD>'671--685'</DD><DD>'Wiley'</DD><DD>'19'</DD>
