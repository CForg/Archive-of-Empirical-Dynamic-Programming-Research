<DT>title<DD>'THE WELFARE IMPACT OF REDUCING CHOICE IN MEDICARE PART D: A COMPARISON OF TWO REGULATION STRATEGIES'</DD><DT>author<DD>'Claudio Lucarelli and Jeffrey Prince and Kosali Simon'</DD><DT>url<DD>'http://www.jstor.org/stable/23352337'</DD><DT>abstract<DD>'Motivated by widely publicized concerns that there are "too many" plans, we structurally estimate (and validate) an equilibrium model of the Medicare Part D market to study the welfare impacts of two feasible, similar-sized approaches for reducing choice. One reduces the maximum number of firm offerings regionally; the other removes plans providing donut hole coverageâ€”consumers' most valued dimension. We find welfare losses are far smaller when coupled with elimination of a dimension of differentiation. We illustrate our findings' relevance under current health care reforms, and consider the merits of instead imposing ex ante competition for entry.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'International Economic Review'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2012'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00206598, 14682354'</DD><DD>'4'</DD><DD>'1155--1177'</DD><DD>'[Economics Department of the University of Pennsylvania, Wiley, Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University]'</DD><DD>'53'</DD>
