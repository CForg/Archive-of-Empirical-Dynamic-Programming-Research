The objective is to maximize the presented discounted value of utility arising from the participation decisions. In addition to duration dependence introduced through time-variant job offer and layoff probabilities, state dependence enters the model by the existence of a different risk while working, namely, the dismissal risk, than the one while not working, namely, the possibility of no job offers. A dynamic programming algorithm is solved and estimated within a maximum likelihood routine, with data from the National Longitudinal Surveys youth cohort.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'The Journal of Human Resources'</DD><DT>year<DD>'1989'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'0022166X'</DD><DD>'2'</DD><DD>'195--220'</DD><DD>'[University of Wisconsin Press, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System]'</DD><DD>'24'</DD>
