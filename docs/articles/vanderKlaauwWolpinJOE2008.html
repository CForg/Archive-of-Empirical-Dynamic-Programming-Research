The model is estimated on a sample of relatively poor households from the first three waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), for whom we would expect social security income to be of particular importance. The estimated model is used to simulate the responses to changes in social security rules, including changes in benefit levels, in the payroll tax, in the social security earnings tax and in early and normal retirement ages. Welfare and budget consequences are estimated.'</DD><DT>doi<DD>'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2008.05.004'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Journal of Econometrics'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2008'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'145'</DD><DD>'1'</DD><DD>'21 - 42'</DD><DD>'The use of econometrics in informing public policy makers'</DD><DD>'0304-4076'</DD><DD>'Retirement, Social security, Structural estimation'</DD>
