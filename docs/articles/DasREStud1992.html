Estimates of a firm's discrete decision problem with regard to an existing piece of capital-whether to operate, hold idle or retire it-are obtained, in the context of the U.S. cement industry, by solving a discrete-choice stochastic dynamic programming model. The estimates are then used to simulate the effects of product and input price changes, and changes in the size and age of a cement kiln on a firm's propensity to operate, hold idle and retire a kiln.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'The Review of Economic Studies'</DD><DT>year<DD>'1992'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00346527, 1467937X'</DD><DD>'2'</DD><DD>'277--297'</DD><DD>'[Oxford University Press, Review of Economic Studies, Ltd.]'</DD><DD>'59'</DD>
