I show that the model fits well data on the duration of negotiations and government durations in postwar Italy. Also, I show that changes in the proposer selection process would not affect either the duration of negotiations or government durations, whereas the imposition of a strict deadline would in general reduce the incentives to delay agreement as well as government durations.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Journal of Political Economy'</DD><DT>year<DD>'1997'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00223808, 1537534X'</DD><DD>'1'</DD><DD>'101--131'</DD><DD>'University of Chicago Press'</DD><DD>'105'</DD>
