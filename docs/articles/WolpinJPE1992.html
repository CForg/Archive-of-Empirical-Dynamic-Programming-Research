A constrained optimization model of labor force dynamics is implemented empirically integrating features of models previously described in the literature. The estimates of the model provide quantitative evidence on underlying structural differences in labor market constraints faced by blacks and whites. For example, while blacks have overall a substantially smaller wage return to work experience and face a less disperse wage offer distribution, blacks face a higher probability of receiving job offers.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Journal of Political Economy'</DD><DT>year<DD>'1992'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00223808, 1537534X'</DD><DD>'3'</DD><DD>'535--560'</DD><DD>'University of Chicago Press'</DD><DD>'100'</DD>
