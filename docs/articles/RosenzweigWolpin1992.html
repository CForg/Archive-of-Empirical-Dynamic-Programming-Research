The model is fit to longitudinal Indian household data on farm profits, bullock stocks, and pump sets. The estimated structural parameters are used to assess the effects on the life cycle accumulation of bullocks, agricultural profits, and welfare associated with complete markets and bullock liquidity and with second-best policies that provide assured sources of income to farmers and weather insurance.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Journal of Political Economy'</DD><DT>year<DD>'1993'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00223808, 1537534X'</DD><DD>'2'</DD><DD>'223--244'</DD><DD>'University of Chicago Press'</DD><DD>'101'</DD>
