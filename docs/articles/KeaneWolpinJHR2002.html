We use the stylized model and associated simulations from Part I as a guide in specifying the approximate decision rules that we estimate here. The estimates are based on data from the 1979 youth cohort of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience (NLSY79).'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'The Journal of Human Resources'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2002'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'0022166X'</DD><DD>'3'</DD><DD>'600--622'</DD><DD>'[University of Wisconsin Press, Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System]'</DD><DD>'37'</DD>
