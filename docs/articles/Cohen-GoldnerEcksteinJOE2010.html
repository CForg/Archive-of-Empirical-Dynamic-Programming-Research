We find that training has a significant impact on the mean offered wage in white-collar occupations, but not in blue-collar occupations. Training substantially increases the job-offer rates in both occupations. Counterfactual policy simulations show a substantial social gain from increasing the access to training programs, and the estimated model provides a good fit for within-sample, out-of-sample and aggregate trends using cross-sectional survey data.'</DD><DT>doi<DD>'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2009.09.009'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Journal of Econometrics'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2010'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'156'</DD><DD>'1'</DD><DD>'86 - 105'</DD><DD>'Structural Models of Optimization Behavior in Labor, Aging, and Health'</DD><DD>'0304-4076'</DD><DD>'Immigration, Occupation, Training, Transitions, Welfare'</DD>
