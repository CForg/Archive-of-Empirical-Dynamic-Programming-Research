We specify a dynamic model of career decisions of a member of Congress and estimate this model using a newly collected dataset. Given estimates of the structural model, we assess reelection probabilities, estimate the effect of congressional experience on private and public sector wages, and quantify the value of a congressional seat. Moreover, we assess how an increase in the congressional wage or the imposition of term limits would affect the career decisions of politicians and the returns from a career in Congress.'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'The American Economic Review'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2005'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'00028282'</DD><DD>'1'</DD><DD>'347--373'</DD><DD>'American Economic Association'</DD><DD>'95'</DD>
