The structural model is used for ex ante evaluation of policies that change the duration of job protection and/or the arrangement for cash benefits. Counterfactual simulations indicate that introducing an initial 1-year job protection policy increases maternal employment significantly, but extending the existing job protection period from 1 to 3 years has little effect. In addition, the employment effects of cash benefits seem modest. Overall, parental leave policies have little effect on fertility.'</DD><DT>doi<DD>'https://doi.org/10.3982/QE965'</DD><DT>journal<DD>'Quantitative Economics'</DD><DT>year<DD>'2019'</DD><DT>Undefined</DT><DD>'10'</DD><DD>'3'</DD><DD>'1195-1232'</DD><DD>'Parental leave, female labor supply, discrete choice model, structural estimation, J13, J22, J24'</DD><DD>'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.3982/QE965'</DD>
