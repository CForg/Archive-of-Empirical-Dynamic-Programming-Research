README file for bus data

This directory contains data on odometer readings and dates of
bus engine replacements of 162 buses in the fleet of the Madison
Metropolitan Bus Company that were in operation sometime during 
the period December, 1974 to May, 1985. The documentation of
the  contents of the files is described in more detail in chapter
4 of the documentation manual. 

The directory contains the following files, each
corresponding to a different model/vintage of bus
in the Madison Metro fleet:

D309.ASC     110x4 matrix for Davidson model 309 buses
G870.ASC     36x15 matrix for Grumman model 870 buses
RT50.ASC     60x4  matrix for Chance model RT50 buses 
T8H203.ASC   81x48 matrix for GMC model T8H203 buses
A452372.ASC 137x18 matrix for GMC model A4523 buses, model year 1972 
A452374.ASC 137x10 matrix for GMC model A4523 buses, model year 1974 
A530872.ASC 137x18 matrix for GMC model A5308 buses, model year 1972 
A530874.ASC 137x12 matrix for GMC model A5308 buses, model year 1974 
A530875.ASC 128x37 matrix for GMC model A5308 buses, model year 1975 

The data in each file are vectorized into  a single column: e.g.
D309.ASC is a 440x1 vector consisting of the columns
of a 110x4 matrix stacked on top of each other consecutively. 

The program config.gpr converts these  ascii files into Gauss
data matrix files (with fmt file extensions) for subsequent
use by the NFXP algorithm.
